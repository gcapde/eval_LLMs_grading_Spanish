# On the effectiveness of LLMs for automatic grading of open-ended questions in Spanish
Repository for the article "On the effectiveness of LLMs for automatic grading of open-ended questions in Spanish" submitted to the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, Springer.

This work is an extension of the previous work presented at IEEE URUCON 2024: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10850479/ (repo can be found here: https://github.com/gcapde/eval_llms_edutech_assessment).


The repository includes:

* The different prompts tested with several LLMs ([prompts.txt](https://github.com/gcapde/eval_LLMs_grading_Spanish/blob/main/prompts.txt)).
* Configuration file to run the tests with promptfoo ([promptfooconfig.yaml](https://github.com/gcapde/eval_LLMs_grading_Spanish/blob/main/promptfooconfig.yaml)).
* JSON files with the experiments results ().
* Python code used to analyze the experiments results (JSON files from promptfoo) and generate the graphs included in the paper (analysis_results.py and Accuracy.py).
